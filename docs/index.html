    <h2 id="policy-heading" class="policy-title">Pomodoro Pro — Privacy Statement</h2>

    <p><strong>Pomodoro Pro does not collect, store, or share any personal user data.</strong> All information created or used by the application (timers, local settings, session history) is processed and saved locally on your device and remains under your control.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Pomodoro Pro operates without requiring user accounts, login, or personal identifiers. The app does not transmit personally identifiable information (PII) to our servers or to third parties.</p>

    <h2>2. Local Processing & Storage</h2>
    <p>Session data, preferences, and any local history are stored on the user's device only. These items are not uploaded, synced, or backed up to any external service by default. You may export data manually from the app if that feature is provided; exports are performed explicitly by the user.</p>

    <h2>3. Analytics and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>By default, Pomodoro Pro does not include analytics, crash reporting, or tracking services that collect personal data. If third-party services are added in the future, this policy will be updated and those additions will be disclosed here.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>Because Pomodoro Pro minimizes external data flow, there is minimal exposure of user data to network risks. You are responsible for the physical and OS-level security of your device to protect any local data.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Material changes will be posted on this page with a revised "Last Updated" date.</p>
